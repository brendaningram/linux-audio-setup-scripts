# Linux Audio Setup Scripts

*By Brendan Ingram*

This repository contains scripts and guides to get you running with a Linux system capable of professional audio engineering and music production.

## I'm considering moving to Linux - how do I get started?

First, watch this video, where I walk through installing my recommended Linux distribution and setting the system up for audio - config, DAW, plugins - ready to go.

[TODO: Video Link COMING SOON](debian/11/install-audio-jack.sh)

Second, consider which Linux distribution is right for you. If you're new, start with my recommendation above.

Third, follow the instructions in the video, and run the appropriate script for your distribution, below.

Finally, music is art, and art is good for the soul - enjoy!

## How do I use these scripts?

Find your distribution in the list below, click the link, and run the **SINGLE** command listed at the top of the file - easy!

## Which distribution do you recommend?
